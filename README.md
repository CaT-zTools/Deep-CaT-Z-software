# DeepCaT-z_Software
DeepCaT-z: Classification and Tracking in depth (z) using deep learning techniques - Software for real-time behavior recognition and automated closed-loop control of behavioral experiments, using depth videos

The DeepCaT-z tool is an integrated computational solution where pre-trained deep learning models are applied for improved computational and task performances. Besides the graphical user interface for real-time analysis of behavioral experiments, this package contains additional functions for preparing the data for the deep learning models and for the training itself.

**A self-explanatory user guide (including installation, deep networks training and Arduino programming steps) is also available, under the name "UserGuide_DeepCaT_z.pdf".**

The non-compiled code is available in the "src" folder.

If you use this software, please acknowledge our work:
